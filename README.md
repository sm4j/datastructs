# Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This collection contains various assignments completed during the Spring 2024 semester as part of my Computer Science coursework. Each implementation showcases fundamental concepts and techniques in computer science.

## Contents

- **ArrayList**: Implementation of a dynamic array that can resize itself as elements are added or removed.
- **BinaryTree**: A representation of a binary tree, including methods for insertion, traversal, and deletion.
- **CharStack**: A stack implementation specifically for character data, demonstrating LIFO (Last In, First Out) operations.
- **LinkedLists**: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists, showcasing various operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Queue**: A queue implementation that follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principles.
- **Sort CPP**: Various sorting algorithms implemented in C++, including selection sort, bubble sort, and quicksort.
- **Stack**: A generic stack implementation demonstrating fundamental stack operations.

## Note

This repository does not include version history, as it consists of individual assignments completed during the Spring 2024 semester. Each file represents a standalone implementation of a specific data structure or algorithm.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the individual files to see the implementations and test the functionalities. If you have any questions or would like to discuss the assignments, please reach out!
